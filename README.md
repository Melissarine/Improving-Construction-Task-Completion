# Improving-Construction-Task-Completion
This project analyzes real-world construction project data to identify why certain tasks get delayed and how to fix them. I performed data cleaning, visual analysis, and machine learning modeling using Python.
## Project Goals
- Identify teams and task types most prone to delays
- Understand when delays peak during the year
- Use ML models to uncover patterns and causes of overdue tasks

## Techniques Used
- ETL with pandas and pathlib
- Data visualization with seaborn and matplotlib
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest for modeling
- Feature importance analysis to explain model results

## Conclusion

- **Design Team delays** are due to long durations and poor documentation.
- **Quality Team delays** often stem from workmanship issues and reactive tasks.
- Delays peak in **March, July, and August**, suggesting seasonal staffing challenges.
